### Abstract:
The objective of the project is to use NLP and machine learning techniques to predict customer satisfaction with products based on their reviews. The dataset contains 71,044 rows and 25 columns, including the product ID, brand, category, review text, and whether the reviewer purchased the product or not. The project will use various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine to predict the outcome, with the maximum accuracy obtained so far being 70%. The project also involves data preprocessing to remove null and duplicate rows, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to analyze the correlation between review rating and the number of words used in the review text, as well as to visualize which words are used most and check if there is any regional impact on the reviews provided. The project also plans to use future classifiers such as Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, KNN, and XLNet to improve accuracy. Overall, the project seeks to use NLP and machine learning to better understand customer satisfaction and to identify factors that influence it.

The active learning process takes as input a set of labeled examples, as well as a larger set of unlabeled examples, and produces a classifier and a relatively small set of newly labeled data. Active learning has been successfully applied to a number of natural language processing tasks, such as, information extraction, named entity recognition, text categorization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and word sense disambiguation. 

With the advent of neural network models for NLP, salient features were learned jointly with the training of the model itself, and hence focus shifted to architecture engineering, where inductive bias was rather provided through the design of a suitable network architecture conducive to learning such features.
